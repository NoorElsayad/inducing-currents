    <h2>What is Electromagnetic Induction?</h2>
    <p>
      Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current from a changing magnetic field.
      It was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. It's the principle behind many everyday devices such as electric generators and transformers.

    <h2>Oersted's Experiment 🧲</h2>
    <p>
      In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current in a wire creates a magnetic field around it. 
      This showed that <strong>electricity can create magnetism</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But later, Faraday and others found the <strong>opposite is also true</strong>: a changing magnetic field can create electricity! 
      This is what electromagnetic induction is all about — the two phenomena are connected.

    <h2>What is EMF?</h2>
    <p>
      EMF stands for <strong>Electromotive Force</strong>, but it doesn’t mean a real "force" — it’s actually a voltage.
      So, EMF is very similar to potential difference (<strong>V</strong>). It tells us how much electrical energy is being pushed through a circuit.
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
      EMF = B × L × V × sin(θ)
    </div>
    <p>
      Where:<br>
      B = magnetic field strength (Tesla)<br>
      L = length of the wire in the magnetic field (meters)<br>
      V = velocity (speed of the wire)<br>
      θ = angle between the wire and the field lines

    <h2>Right-Hand Rule ✋</h2>
    <p>
      To find the direction of the induced current, use the <strong>right-hand rule</strong> for generators:
    </p>
    <p>
      ➤ Point your thumb in the direction of the wire's motion (velocity).<br>
      ➤ Point your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
      ➤ Your palm will face the direction of the induced current (conventional current).

    <h2>Real-Life Application: Microphones 🎤</h2>
    <p>
      Microphones work based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. In a typical microphone, there is a diaphragm that vibrates in response to sound waves. 
      Attached to this diaphragm is a coil of wire that moves within a magnetic field. As the coil moves, it cuts through the magnetic lines of force, inducing an electric current.
      This current is then sent to an amplifier, which converts the vibrations into an audio signal. This is how sound is transformed into an electrical signal in microphones.
